An atom is most stable when its outermost shell is not completely filled with electrons.

Options A: True
Options B: False Correct answer: False Blooms Taxonomy Level: Comprehension
Ionic bonds form as a result of the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, leading to the formation of ions.

Options A: True
Options B: False Correct answer: True Blooms Taxonomy Level: Comprehension
Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms and can dissociate in water.

Options A: True
Options B: False Correct answer: False Blooms Taxonomy Level: Application
Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions require more energy to break compared to ionic and covalent bonds.

Options A: True
Options B: False Correct answer: False Blooms Taxonomy Level: Analysis
The octet rule states that an atom aims to have eight electrons in its outermost shell for maximum stability.

Options A: True
Options B: False Correct answer: True Blooms Taxonomy Level: Comprehension
A sodium atom donates an electron to a chlorine atom because it is less energy-intensive for sodium to accept seven electrons to fill its outer shell.

Options A: True
Options B: False Correct answer: False Blooms Taxonomy Level: Application
