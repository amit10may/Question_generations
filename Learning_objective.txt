Define and understand the concept of life, including the complexities and challenges associated with defining what constitutes a living organism.
Identify and describe the shared properties and functions that characterize living organisms, including order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution.
Explain the significance of adaptation as a result of evolution by natural selection and its impact on the diversity and fit of organisms to their environment.
Comprehend the role of reproduction in the continuity of life and the diversity of mechanisms by which organisms reproduce.
Understand the importance of homeostasis and regulatory mechanisms in maintaining life.
Recognize the essential role of energy processing in the metabolic activities of all living organisms.
Grasp the concept of evolution as a fundamental principle that explains the diversity of life on Earth, driven by mutations and natural selection.
